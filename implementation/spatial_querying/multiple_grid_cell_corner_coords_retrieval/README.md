<h1>MULTIPLE GRID CELL CORNER COORDINATES RETRIEVAL</h1>

---

# About
This set of programs aims to retreive the corner coordinates of multiple grid cells together.

# Purpose
This is useful in collision detection, since it forms the basis of checking whether an agent overlaps with any obstacle grids around it.
