# About
A repository to explore autonomous navigation-related functionality for:

- Single agents
- Multi-agent systems

---

> **Key theoretical reference**: [**Autonomous Navigation**, **pranigopu.github.io**]([./ideation](https://pranigopu.github.io/autonomous-navigation/))

Contains explanations and notes exploring and motivating solution approaches.

# Implementation
Code to implement:

- Single agent path planning
- Multi-agent path planning
- Text-based simulation
- Dash-based animation (via Plotly)
- Spatial querying (overlap/collision detection, multi-cell processing, etc.)
